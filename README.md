# üêò spuffs.social ‚Äì Your Mastodon home

**spuffs.social** is part of the Mastodon network ‚Äî a decentralized, community-run alternative to Twitter/X. This guide will help you get started.

## What is Mastodon?
---

Mastodon is a social media platform similar to Twitter but with a twist: it's **federated**. That means there‚Äôs no single company in charge. Instead, Mastodon is made up of independently run servers (called **instances**), like **spuffs.social**, that talk to each other.

You can follow people on **any** Mastodon instance ‚Äî not just the one you signed up on.

## Key Differences From Twitter

## Tweets vs Toots vs Posts

On Mastodon, posts are called **toots** (or just **posts** these days). They can include:

- Text (500+ characters)
- Images, videos, audio
- Polls
- Content Warnings (CW) ‚Äî to hide spoilers, sensitive topics, etc.

## Boosts, Stars, Replies, Bookmarks
---

- üîÅ **Boost**: Shares the post to your followers, allowing it to appear in their Home feed. This is a useful mechanism for spreading the reach of the post in particular.
- ‚≠êÔ∏è **Star**: Like or favorite a post. Notifies the author of the post that you liked it. The post also gets added to your favorites.
- üí¨ ‚Éî **Reply**: Starts a thread or conversation as a reply to a post.
- üîñ **Bookmark**: It adds it to your bookmarks, allowing you to more easily find the post again later on. Does not notify the author that you bookmarked their post. It's just for your own use.

## Privacy Controls
---

When you post, you can choose who sees it:

- üåç **Public**: Visible to everyone
- üë• **Followers Only**: Only people who follow you
- üì¨ **Mentioned People Only**: Like a direct message (but not end-to-end encrypted)

## Media Tips
---

- Up to 4 images per post
- Videos and audio are supported
- You can add alt text for accessibility
- Use the CW feature to hide spoilers or sensitive images

## üîç Finding People
---

- You can follow users on other instances like: `@coolperson@mastodon.social`
- Use search to find people by username, hashtag, or post content

## Customize Your Experience
---

## Community Guidelines
---

Each instance has its own rules. On **spuffs.social**, we focus on being kind, respectful, and spam-free. Read the full guidelines [here](https://spuffs.social/about).


## Following people in other instances
---

You can follow people outside of the spuffs.social instance.  This allows you to see posts from them in your **Other Servers** live feeds (web interface) or **Live feed** (mobile app).

### Method 1: From their profile

1. Copy the person's full Mastodon handle (looks like @username@instance.social)
2. Paste it into the search bar on your own instance
3. Click on their profile when it appears
4. Click the "Follow" button

### Method 2: Using the remote follow feature

1. Visit their profile on their instance (you'll see it in your browser)
2. Click the "Follow" or "Subscribe" button
3. A dialog will appear asking for your handle
4. Enter your full Mastodon address (@yourname@yourinstance.social)
5. You'll be redirected to your own instance to confirm the follow

## Other people's post visibility

Post/toot visibility depends on the Mastodon instance they are on and if you follow them.  The followin flowchart helps illustrate this:
