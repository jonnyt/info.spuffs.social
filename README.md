# 🐘 spuffs.social – Your Mastodon home

**spuffs.social** is part of the Mastodon network — a decentralized, community-run alternative to Twitter/X. This guide will help you get started.

## What is Mastodon?
---

Mastodon is a social media platform similar to Twitter but with a twist: it's **federated**. That means there’s no single company in charge. Instead, Mastodon is made up of independently run servers (called **instances**), like **spuffs.social**, that talk to each other.

You can follow people on **any** Mastodon instance — not just the one you signed up on.

## Key Differences From Twitter

|--------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|

## Understanding the Interface
---

- **Home**: Posts from people you follow

- **Federated**: Posts from across the whole Mastodon network  
- **Notifications**: Likes, replies, boosts, and follows  
- **Explore/Search**: Hashtags, users, and trending posts  

## Tweets vs Toots vs Posts
---

On Mastodon, posts are called **toots** (or just “posts” these days). They can include:

- Text (500+ characters)  
- Images, videos, audio  
- Polls  
- Content Warnings (CW) — to hide spoilers, sensitive topics, etc.

## Boosts, Stars, Replies, Bookmarks
---

- 🔁 **Boost**: Shares the post to your followers, allowing it to appear in their Home feed. This is a useful mechanism for spreading the reach of the post in particular.
- ⭐️ **Star**: Like or favorite a post. Notifies the author of the post that you liked it. The post also gets added to your favorites.
- 💬 ⃔ **Reply**: Starts a thread or conversation as a reply to a post.
- 🔖 **Bookmark**: It adds it to your bookmarks, allowing you to more easily find the post again later on. Does not notify the author that you bookmarked their post. It's just for your own use.

## Privacy Controls
---

When you post, you can choose who sees it:

- 🌍 **Public**: Visible to everyone  
- 👥 **Followers Only**: Only people who follow you  
- 📬 **Mentioned People Only**: Like a direct message (but not end-to-end encrypted)  

## Media Tips
---

- Up to 4 images per post  
- Videos and audio are supported  
- You can add alt text for accessibility  
- Use the CW feature to hide spoilers or sensitive images  

## 🔍 Finding People
---
