# 🐘 Welcome to Spuffs.social – Your Guide to Mastodon

**Spuffs.social** is part of the Mastodon network — a decentralized, community-run alternative to Twitter/X. Whether you’re a casual poster, news junkie, or tech enthusiast, this guide will help you get started.

## 🌍 What is Mastodon?

Mastodon is a social media platform similar to Twitter but with a twist: it's **federated**. That means there’s no single company in charge. Instead, Mastodon is made up of independently run servers (called **instances**), like **spuffs.social**, that talk to each other.

You can follow people on **any** Mastodon instance — not just the one you signed up on.
